# Data Usage Instructions for the Paper

## I. Data Overview

### (i) DEM Data
- **Format**: .tif
- **Spatial Resolution**: 30m×30m
- **Data Content**: This data reflects the terrain elevation information of the study area, used for simulating the impact of terrain on hydrological processes, such as flow direction and slope, and is one of the fundamental data for constructing hydrological models.

### (ii) LUCC (Land Use/Land Cover Change) Data
- **Format**: .tif
- **Spatial Resolution**: 1km×1km
- **Data Content**: It records in detail the land use types (such as arable land, forest land, construction land, etc.) and land cover conditions (such as vegetation cover, etc.) of the study area. By analyzing LUCC data, the impact of land use changes on the hydrological cycle and ecological processes can be studied, providing dynamic land use scenario inputs for model simulation.

### (iii) Precipitation Data
- **Format**: .txt
- **Time Resolution**: daily precipitation
- **Data Content**: It contains the precipitation information of the study area and is an important driving factor in hydrological models. Precipitation data is used to simulate the rainfall - runoff process and analyze the impact of rainfall on surface runoff, soil erosion, and other hydrological elements, serving as a key input data for studying the hydrological response of the area.

### (iv) Soil Data
- **Format**: .tif
- **Attribute Content**: Includes key attributes such as soil type (such as loam, sandy soil, clay, etc.), soil texture (such as particle size distribution), soil permeability coefficient, soil water holding capacity, etc.
- **Spatial Resolution**: 1km×1km
- **Data Content**: The soil data reflects the physical and hydrological characteristics of the soil in the study area and is crucial for simulating soil water movement and infiltration processes in hydrological models. Through soil data, the soil's interception of rainfall, infiltration, and groundwater recharge processes can be accurately depicted, providing soil attribute support for precise model simulation.
